# Goldbach Decomposer

This site allows users to decompose any even number **E â‰¥ 4** into a pair of prime numbers **(p, q)** such that:

> E = p + q

This implements a practical exploration of the **Strong Goldbach Conjecture**, which states that **every even integer â‰¥ 4** is the sum of two prime numbers.

## ðŸ”¢ How to Use

1. Enter an even number in the input field (e.g. 100, 10^6, or even 10^18).
2. The system searches for a valid pair (p, q) such that p + q = E.
3. The first valid pair found is displayed, along with the computation time.

## âœ… Example

Input: `100`

Output:  
`Goldbach pair: 47 + 53 = 100`  
`Time: 0.2 ms`

---

## ðŸš€ Capabilities

- Tested successfully up to **10^18**
- Efficient and lightweight JavaScript implementation
- Instant results for most even numbers

---

## ðŸ“Œ Note

This project is **focused exclusively on Goldbach decompositions**.  
It does **not** perform factorization of odd numbers or primes checking beyond the decomposition.
